              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p><strong>5.1</strong> The material displayed on our Site is provided without any guarantees, conditions or warranties as to its accuracy and is provided on an "as is" basis. To the extent permitted by law, we hereby expressly exclude all conditions, warranties and other terms which might otherwise be implied by any law, regulation, statute, common law or law of equity. Although we aim to offer you the best service possible, we make no promise that the services at the Site will meet your requirements and cannot guarantee that the services will be fault-free.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.2</strong> Your access to the Site may be occasionally restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance or the introduction of new facilities or services and any such interruptions shall not constitute a breach by us of these Terms. We will attempt to restore the service as soon as we reasonably can.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.3</strong> From time to time, it may be necessary to suspend access to the Site for a period of time and any such interruptions shall not constitute a breach by us of these Terms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.4</strong> If you choose to use the Site, you do so at your own risk. You acknowledge and agree that we do not have an obligation to verify any listing or conduct background checks on the Owners, Drivers or on any parking spaces listed on the Site.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.5</strong> You understand that we do not make any attempt to verify the statements provided by the Owner which are published on the Site describing the key details of the listing (including, but not limited to, the location of the parking space, features of the parking space and instructions to obtain access to the parking space) or to verify, review or visit any parking spaces. We make no representations, endorsements or warranties as to the completeness of the information provided by the Owners and/or Drivers, the conduct of the Owners and/or Drivers, or the compatibility with any current or future Owners and/or Drivers using the Site.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.6</strong> We will not be liable for any business, financial, or economic loss, nor for any consequential or indirect loss (such as lost reputation, lost profit or lost opportunity) arising as a result of, or in connection with, your use of the Site, whether such loss is incurred or suffered as a result of our negligence or otherwise.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.7</strong> We will not be liable for: (a) losses not caused by our breach; (b) any and all indirect losses to the fullest extent permitted by law (which means loss to you which is a side effect of the main loss or damage, and where you and we could not have reasonably expected that loss would arise at the time of entering into these terms); (c) any loss arising as a result of the accuracy, timeliness, completeness or usefulness of any information provided by us or in connection with the Site; (d) failure to provide our services or to meet any of our obligations under these Terms where such failure is due to events beyond our control (for example a network failure); (e) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to and/or use of the Site and/or services and/or any booking with an Owner and/or Driver, to the fullest extent permissible by law (for clarity, we will not be liable in any way, in any circumstances, for any and all injury, liability or damage (including damage to the car park, building, vehicle and/or personal property) of the user or any third party).</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.8</strong> Without prejudice to clause 5.7 above, for clarity, if you are listing your parking space on the Site, you will be solely responsible and liable for ensuring that your use of the Site is in compliance with any and all rules and regulations applicable to you (including, but not limited to, your building rules and regulations and/or any lease/tenancy agreement requirements).

                    <p><strong>4.1 General Process</strong></p>
                    <p>To request a Parking Space listed on the Site, you must submit a booking request by selecting your required dates and providing valid payment details (the "Booking Request").</p>
                    
                    <p>Upon submission of a Booking Request, we will, at our sole discretion, either immediately charge your payment method or place a pre-authorisation hold for the applicable booking amount.</p>
                    
                    <p>Within 48 hours of the Booking Request, we will confirm the availability of the Parking Space with the Owner. If the space is available, we will proceed as follows:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                      <li>if a pre-authorisation hold was placed, the corresponding amount will be charged at that time; or</li>
                      <li>if payment was already processed, no further action is needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>If your Booking Request has been accepted, you will receive a booking confirmation via email and/or through your Account, which includes access details and a link to the in-Site chat where you may coordinate directly with the Owner to access the Parking Space.</p>
                    
                    <p>If the Parking Space is not available, then we will either:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                      <li>refund the charged amount (if payment was collected), or</li>
                      <li>cancel the pre-authorisation hold (if applicable),</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>in both cases within ten (10) working days.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>4.2 Access Cards and Deposits</strong></p>
                    <p>In cases where access to the Parking Space requires a physical access card or device, a separate access card fee will be charged at the time of the Booking Request (the "Refundable Access Charge").</p>
                    
                    <p>The Refundable Access Charge will be refunded to you within ten (10) working days after the end of the Booking Period, but only if the Owner confirms that:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                      <li>the access card or device has been returned in good condition, and</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>If the Owner reports any issues or non-return of the access card/device, the Refundable Access Charge may be withheld in part or in full at our sole discretion.</p>
