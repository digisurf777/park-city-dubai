                <p><strong>1.2</strong> These terms and conditions of use ("Terms") will apply to anyone who accesses or uses the Site ("you").

              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p><strong>5.1</strong> The material displayed on our Site is provided without any guarantees, conditions or warranties as to its accuracy and is provided on an "as is" basis. To the extent permitted by law, we hereby expressly exclude all conditions, warranties and other terms which might otherwise be implied by any law, regulation, statute, common law or law of equity. Although we aim to offer you the best service possible, we make no promise that the services at the Site will meet your requirements and cannot guarantee that the services will be fault-free.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.2</strong> Your access to the Site may be occasionally restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance or the introduction of new facilities or services and any such interruptions shall not constitute a breach by us of these Terms. We will attempt to restore the service as soon as we reasonably can.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.3</strong> From time to time, it may be necessary to suspend access to the Site for a period of time and any such interruptions shall not constitute a breach by us of these Terms.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.4</strong> If you choose to use the Site, you do so at your own risk. You acknowledge and agree that we do not have an obligation to verify any listing or conduct background checks on the Owners, Drivers or on any parking spaces listed on the Site.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.5</strong> You understand that we do not make any attempt to verify the statements provided by the Owner which are published on the Site describing the key details of the listing (including, but not limited to, the location of the parking space, features of the parking space and instructions to obtain access to the parking space) or to verify, review or visit any parking spaces. We make no representations, endorsements or warranties as to the completeness of the information provided by the Owners and/or Drivers, the conduct of the Owners and/or Drivers, or the compatibility with any current or future Owners and/or Drivers using the Site.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.6</strong> We will not be liable for any business, financial, or economic loss, nor for any consequential or indirect loss (such as lost reputation, lost profit or lost opportunity) arising as a result of, or in connection with, your use of the Site, whether such loss is incurred or suffered as a result of our negligence or otherwise.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.7</strong> We will not be liable for: (a) losses not caused by our breach; (b) any and all indirect losses to the fullest extent permitted by law (which means loss to you which is a side effect of the main loss or damage, and where you and we could not have reasonably expected that loss would arise at the time of entering into these terms); (c) any loss arising as a result of the accuracy, timeliness, completeness or usefulness of any information provided by us or in connection with the Site; (d) failure to provide our services or to meet any of our obligations under these Terms where such failure is due to events beyond our control (for example a network failure); (e) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to and/or use of the Site and/or services and/or any booking with an Owner and/or Driver, to the fullest extent permissible by law (for clarity, we will not be liable in any way, in any circumstances, for any and all injury, liability or damage (including damage to the car park, building, vehicle and/or personal property) of the user or any third party).</p>
                
                <p><strong>5.8</strong> Without prejudice to clause 5.7 above, for clarity, if you are listing your parking space on the Site, you will be solely responsible and liable for ensuring that your use of the Site is in compliance with any and all rules and regulations applicable to you (including, but not limited to, your building rules and regulations and/or any lease/tenancy agreement requirements).

                <p><strong>5.9</strong> If we breach these Terms or are otherwise liable to you for any other type of claim, we shall only be liable to you for losses up to the greater of: (a) the amount paid by you to us in relation to the services giving rise to the dispute between us; or (b) AED 500, unless otherwise required by law including as relating to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.</p>
